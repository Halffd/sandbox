# Sandbox

Quick experiments and proof-of-concepts across different languages and domains.

## Structure

- `cpp/` - Systems programming, game dev, performance-critical stuff
- `java/` - Enterprise patterns, Android experiments
- `kotlin/` - JVM interop, modern language features
- `python/` - Automation, data processing, rapid prototyping
- `rust/` - Memory safety experiments, systems programming
- `go/` - Concurrency patterns, web services
- `misc/` - One-off experiments in other languages

## Philosophy

Learning through building, not tutorials. Each directory contains actual problems being solved, not academic exercises.

## Usage

Each language directory is independent. No shared dependencies or complex build systems - just focused experimentation.
